# jest-practice-tests

These practice modules were my first look at jest tests. I had to write up three tests including calculator, capitalize, reverse string and caesar cipher. 

## What I learned 

- Some of the benefits of writing tests for your modules or functions. It can make it easier to reason with your codebase.
- If tests are written first, and you know what your functions should return, it can simplify elements of your code because when you know what to expect, there would be less room to overcomplicate a solution.

## How I could improve moving forward

- My next step is to work with some mock functions, as there are plenty of situations where I'd want to test out asynchronous code but not make 100s of real API calls. Mock functions would help me do this, by mocking the return value from a async call.
